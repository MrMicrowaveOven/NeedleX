## WorkFlow Guidelines

1. Everything is a PR.  Please don't push to master.  It makes it hard to track who did what when.
2. At least 75% of the Engineers (rounded up) must approve a PR.  This is so everyone maintains knowledge of the codebase, and any new features that are added.  A simple "LGTM" comment is considered approval.
3. Please log changes via a Trello ticket.  If you'd like to add a feature, make it a Trello ticket first.  This will make it easier for Non-Engineers to know when a new feature has been rolled out.
4. Code review is good!  Please take criticism well.  On that same note, don't be afraid to be say something if something could be done a better way.

So let's go change some lives people!
